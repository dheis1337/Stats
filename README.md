### Overview
This repository is dedicated to the work I did during my Statistical Theory
course during my undergraduate studies. In this course, I learned the probabilistic
underpinnings of statistics, data exploration, variable correlation and independence,
as well as techniques related to bootstrapping and sampling distributions.
